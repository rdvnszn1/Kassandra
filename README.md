Machine Learning for Predicting Football Games’ Outcome


Football industry has gained huge importance over the last decades. The money and the
followers changed the perception of football from a sport to a market where both insiders,
managers and players, and outsiders, fans and businessmen, play with a huge money. These
developments also generate another market so called the betting market. In these two markets,
answer of a question rises and plays an important role “Who is going to win this match?”.
Predicting the outcome of a football match gives various advantages to a manager or a
bookmaker. Managers determine his tactics and bookmaker determine his odds according to
these outcomes. When this is so important, these circumstances make this question a problem
that is needed to solve.
ML techniques can give a reliable solution to this problem. Nowadays, when
electronically available data are so numerous, it is easy to employ a ML method. We construct 
a classification model based on our training data set because we try to see that the match is
going to end with win, draw or lose for a team. As classification necessitates, we use supervised
learning techniques since we try to develop a predictive model based on both input and output
data.
In other section of this paper, we give some statistical analysis and data exploration such
as correlation between our features in our raw data. Then, we study how we reconstruct our
data by selecting our features based on some feature selection methods such as Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Then, we
examine the results we get from every ML methods and we will compare ML methods with
each other.



What if we bet with our algorithm?
